# gtfo
This project is forked from https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gtfo.

This is a standalone script written in Python 3 for [GTFOBins](https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io).
You can search for Unix binaries that can be exploited to bypass system security restrictions.
These binaries can be abused to ~~get the f**k~~ break out of restricted shells, escalate privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, etc...

The functions are from [https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io](https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io) and all credit goes to its respective contributors.
They are simplified (no need for environmental variables) and syntax highlighted.
